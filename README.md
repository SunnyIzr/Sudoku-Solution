Sudoku-Solution
===============
My Sudoku Solution with a Heavy Emphasis on Single Responsibility Principle: An 81 digit string of numbers is provided as the sudoku board where '0' indicates a blank cell.  
* Sudoku1 only uses process of elimination to find a solution
* Sudoku2 uses guessing to find a solution
